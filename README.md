# DotEnv Highlighter

This package provides highlighting for the [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) configuration files. The files are simple but it does make life a little bit easier to have some syntax highlighting when editing configuration files -- that's what this package delivers.
